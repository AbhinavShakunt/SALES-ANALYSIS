# SALES-ANALYSIS

## Overview

This project utilized Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib to conduct a comprehensive analysis of store sales data spanning 12 months. The dataset contained information on product types, sales amounts, purchase addresses, and more.

## Key Highlights

- **Data Cleaning and Transformation:** The project began with data cleaning tasks to enhance data quality, including:
  - Removing rows with missing values (NaN) to ensure data integrity.
  - Filtering rows based on specific conditions to refine the dataset.
  - Changing column types using methods like `to_numeric`, `to_datetime`, and `astype` to prepare the data for analysis.

- **Exploring Business Questions:** Five key business questions were explored using Pandas and Matplotlib:
  - **Best Sales Month:** Identified the most profitable month and calculated the earnings for that period.
  - **Top-Selling City:** Determined the city with the highest product sales.
  - **Optimal Advertisement Timing:** Analyzed data to find the best times for displaying ads to maximize customer purchases.
  - **Frequently Sold Products:** Investigated which products were commonly sold together.
  - **Best-Selling Product:** Determined the top-selling product and provided insights into its success.

- **Data Analysis Techniques:** Employed various Pandas and Matplotlib techniques, including:
  - Concatenating multiple CSV files to create a unified DataFrame.
  - Parsing cell contents as strings to generate new columns.
  - Using the `.apply()` method for customized data transformations.
  - Utilizing `groupby` for aggregate analysis.
  - Creating informative bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts for visualizing results.
  - Adding labels to enhance graph clarity.

- **Informed Decision-Making:** The project aimed to provide actionable insights for data-driven decisions, enabling improvements in sales strategies and product offerings.

## Insights

The analysis provided the following key insights:

1. **Seasonal Sales Trends:** Revealed seasonal variations in sales, facilitating targeted promotions during peak months.

2. **City-Based Sales Strategy:** Identified top-selling cities, enabling localized marketing efforts and inventory management.

3. **Advertisement Timing:** Determined optimal advertisement display times for maximizing customer engagement and conversions.

4. **Product Affinities:** Found product pairs frequently purchased together, supporting bundle offers and cross-selling strategies.

5. **Best-Selling Product Attributes:** Explored why the best-selling product outperformed others, aiding inventory management and future product development.
